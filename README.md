**Project Name: IMDb Dataset Analysis**

**Introduction:**
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the IMDb dataset. The IMDb dataset is a rich source of information about various movies, including details like titles, genres, ratings, revenues, and more. In this project, we aim to explore this dataset to gain insights into the world of movies. By analyzing the dataset, we can uncover trends, patterns, and interesting facts about movies and the film industry.

**Project Objectives:**
The primary objectives of this IMDb dataset analysis project are as follows:

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Rename columns for better clarity.
- Adjust data types to appropriate formats.
- Remove duplicate entries and handle missing values.

**General Insights:**
- Display the total number of movies in the dataset.
- Determine the number of movies with a runtime greater than or equal to 180 minutes.
- Identify the year with the highest average vote.
- Analyze the average voting trends by year.
- Explore the number of movies produced each year.

**Rating Analysis:**
- Categorize movies into "Poor," "Average," and "Great" based on their ratings.
- Visualize and analyze the distribution of movies across these rating categories.

**Genre Analysis:**
- Identify the top 10 movie genres with the most entries.
- Determine the total revenue generated by different movie genres.
- Visualize the findings to better understand genre preferences.

**Top Movies:**
- Find the top 5 most voted movies.
- Find the top 5 highest-rated movies.
- Find the top 5 lowest-rated movies.
- Find the top 5 most profitable movies based on revenue.
